## üß† Advanced Memory Management

Our Campus Companion features **gracious MongoDB integration** for consistent memory management:

### **Persistent Conversation Storage**
- Every chat interaction is stored in MongoDB with user-specific conversation threads

- Combines conversation history with real-time campus data for comprehensive responses
- Maintains conversation continuity across sessions and devices

### **Smart Academic Mentoring**
- Tracks missed classes and provides specific catch-up advice
- References previous academic discussions to offer targeted study recommendations
- Builds long-term academic relationship with students through persistent memory

### **Memory Architecture**
```javascript
// Conversation stored per user with complete context
{
  userId: "student123",
  history: [
    { role: "user", parts: [{ text: "What's my timetable?" }] },
    { role: "model", parts: [{ text: "Here's your schedule..." }] }
  ],
  updatedAt: "2024-01-20T10:30:00Z"
}
```
